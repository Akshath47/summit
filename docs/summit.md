# Summit

I chose the name **Summit** because it reflects the core purpose of the app: helping users steadily work toward their peak potential.  

Just as a summit is the highest point of a journey, this tool is designed to guide students through daily tasks, schedules, and focus suggestions in a way that supports long-term progress.  

The name emphasizes both planning and achievement, while also carrying the sense of a companion on the climb â€” not just tracking to-dos, but encouraging each step toward the top.
