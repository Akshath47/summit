## ðŸš§ In Progress / Planned Features

### High Priority

#### 1. Persistent Storage Migration
**Current State**: Using `InMemoryStore` - data lost on restart
**Target State**: SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence
**Impact**: Critical for production use
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Implementation Plan**:
- Replace `InMemoryStore()` with persistent store
- Update `langgraph.json` configuration
- Add database schema initialization
- Test data migration and integrity

**Code Reference**: `agent.py:38` - "# TODO : Implement persistent storage with SQLite or Postgres"

#### 2. Client-Side Streaming
**Current State**: Synchronous responses
**Target State**: Real-time partial message streaming
**Impact**: Major UX improvement for long responses
**Estimated Effort**: High (1-2 weeks)

**Implementation Plan**:
- Implement LangGraph streaming capabilities
- Update response synthesizer for incremental output
- Add frontend streaming support
- Handle partial tool call updates

**Code Reference**: `agent.py:866` - "# TODO : Client side streaming of messages to get partial updates on tool calls"

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Conflict Detection
**Current State**: Stubbed in scheduler agent
**Target State**: AI-powered scheduling conflict resolution
**Impact**: Prevents double-booking and scheduling errors
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

**Features**:
- Detect overlapping events
- Suggest alternative times
- Priority-based conflict resolution
- User notification of conflicts

#### 4. Enhanced Focus Suggestions
**Current State**: Basic mood-energy matching
**Target State**: Advanced personalization with learning
**Impact**: Better user engagement and effectiveness
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (1 week)

**Improvements**:
- Learning from user preferences
- Historical success tracking
- Context-aware suggestions (time of day, day of week)
- A/B testing of suggestion strategies

### Low Priority / Future Enhancements

#### 5. Testing Suite
**Current State**: No automated tests
**Target State**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
**Impact**: Code reliability and refactoring confidence
**Estimated Effort**: High (2-3 weeks)

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests for individual agents
- Integration tests for graph flows
- End-to-end conversation testing
- Memory persistence testing

#### 6. Web Interface
**Current State**: CLI-only
**Target State**: Modern web application
**Impact**: Accessibility and user adoption
**Estimated Effort**: High (3-4 weeks)

**Requirements**:
- React/Next.js frontend
- Real-time chat interface
- Calendar visualization
- Task management UI

#### 7. External Integrations
**Current State**: Standalone system
**Target State**: Connected ecosystem
**Impact**: Increased utility and user retention
**Estimated Effort**: Variable (per integration)

**Potential Integrations**:
- Google Calendar sync
- Todoist/Things 3 import
- Slack notifications
- Email reminders
- Fitness tracker mood data

#### 8. Advanced AI Features
**Current State**: Basic LLM interactions
**Target State**: Sophisticated AI capabilities
**Impact**: Competitive differentiation
**Estimated Effort**: Ongoing research

**Features**:
- Multi-modal input (voice, images)
- Advanced natural language understanding
- Predictive task suggestions
- Automated workflow learning

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Memory Persistence**: InMemoryStore prevents production deployment
2. **No Automated Testing**: Risk of regressions during development
3. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic validation only

### Performance Concerns
1. **Sequential Processing**: Agents run sequentially rather than truly parallel
2. **LLM Latency**: Each agent call adds response time
3. **Memory Scaling**: Current implementation may not scale to many users

### Code Quality
1. **Debug Code**: Extensive print statements should be replaced with proper logging
2. **Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values (temperatures, limits) should be configurable
3. **Type Hints**: Some areas lack complete type annotations

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds for typical interactions
- **Accuracy**: > 90% correct task/event extraction
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB per active user session

### User Experience Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: > 80% of created tasks completed
- **User Retention**: > 70% monthly active users
- **Satisfaction Score**: > 4.5/5 user rating

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **LLM API Dependency**: OpenAI API changes or outages
- **Cost Scaling**: LLM costs may become prohibitive at scale
- **Data Privacy**: User data handling and GDPR compliance

### Medium Risk
- **Competition**: Similar products entering market
- **Technology Changes**: LangGraph or LangChain breaking changes
- **User Adoption**: Convincing users to switch from existing tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- **API Diversification**: Support multiple LLM providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Implement caching and batching
- **Privacy-First**: Design with privacy by default
- **Agile Development**: Regular user feedback integration
